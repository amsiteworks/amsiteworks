        	<p>My name is Anthony Mantz, and I created AMSiteworks to share my recent web development and design experiences with you, and the rest of the professional community. The portfolio is meant to showcase my abilities using a variety of web languages, tools, and technologies including HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Javascript, JQuery, SQL, and various Adobe Proudcts.</p>
            <p>A little background about me... I have always been interested in computers and technology, having become the "Family IT Guy" at my house at a young age. However, I didn't realize it was what I wanted to do for a living for many years because I was nurturing my other passion, music. I received my B.A. in Music from California State University, Fullerton in 2004 and opened up a recording studio shortly after graduating (still deep in technology, just with lots of knobs, buttons, and things that light up!). Although I still do freelance recording, I decided I needed a more stable career so I went back to school to learn the inner workings of web development. After completing my Certificate in Web Development from Norco College I began freelancing as a web developer. Now I am constantly on the lookout for new opportunities and ready to dive in!</p>
